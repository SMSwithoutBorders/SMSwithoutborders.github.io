:::

## Setup Guide

Please follow the instructions below to setup this project

## Requirements

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= v14
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Configure environment variables

Create development and production .env configuration files with defaults

```bash
make config
```

SMSWithoutBorders global config variables can also be passed in to override the default config

```bash
SWOB_BE_HOST=http://localhost:9000 SWOB_RECAPTCHA_ENABLE=true SWOB_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=skfhk123 <command>
```

Where command could be any one defined under scripts in package.json or Makefile target e.g `yarn start`, `make build`

**.env.development.local** is used in development environments and **.env.production.local** is used when creating production builds.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which specifies variable naming conventions

Below are the defaults. a reference is also kept in [env.example](https://github.com/smswithoutborders/smswithoutborders.com/blob/main/env.example)

## Start development server

```bash
yarn start
```

**Note** configs are checked and regenerated each time yarn start is run. .env.development will not be overriten if it already exists but .env.production will.

Open [http://localhost:18000](http://localhost:18000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Create a production build

For docker, see docker section below.

Create an optimized production build that can be hosted on servers. This step uses the variables in **.env.production.local**

```bash
yarn build or make build
```

Check the `build` folder for deployable files once complete.

## Deployment

### Standard deployment with apache

For a Linux/Ubuntu server running apache2 web server, follow these steps to deploy the site

- Enable rewrite module

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite
```

- Open apache configuration file at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
- Change the AllowOverride permission from none to all

```bash
<Directory /var/www/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</Directory>
```

- Copy contents of build folder to server root normally located at /var/www/html. Ensure the .htaccess file is copied over. The .htaccess file is quite important as specified [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#static-server)

```bash
sudo cp -r build/. /var/www/html
```

- restart apache2

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Docker

The SWOB docker image is designed to run in a production environment therefore, SSL keys are required

Start by building the docker image. There is a make script you can run. Also, SWOB env overrides can be passed directly to this command. See configuring env variables above.

```bash
SWOB_SSL_ENABLE=true SWOB_SSL_CRT_FILE=/path/to/server.crt SWOB_SSL_KEY_FILE=/path/to/server.key make image
```

You can also pass other SWOB env variable to be used instead of the defaults.

```bash
SWOB_RECAPTCHA_ENABLE=true SWOB_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=somekeyhere make image
```

A full list of all env variables can be found under `configure env variables` section above

Once build completes, a `swob-fe:latest` image is created. The image exposes ports `80` and `443` which can be mapped as required

You can test the image by running `make container` and visit `http://localhost:18000`and `https://localhost:18001` in the browser or deploying with your own docker config options
