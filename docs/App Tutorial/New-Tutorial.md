### Step 5. Save access to platforms​

One of the key features of SWOB is to be able to save access to online platforms while you have an active internet, then use the App to make requests to these platforms without an active internet connection. Once you login and click on **Save Accounts**, you will have a list of platforms we currently support. You can save your credentials for as many platforms as you can foresee further need in an offline situation.

**NB: You have to have any platform you want to save access installed in your phone already.**

### Step 7. Configure your App and begin utilizing​

Once you've linked your apps to your SWOB  account, you'll need to add your gateway client number or select one from the list of available gateway clients. One important setting to configure is selecting the Gateway number for communication. It is cheaper to Opt for a Gateway number  from the same service provider as yours or within your country.
