### Step 5. Save access to platforms​

One of the key features of SWOB is to be able to save access to online platforms while you have an active internet, then use the App to make requests to these platforms without an active internet connection. Once you login and click on **Save Accounts**, you will have a list of platforms we currently support. You can save your credentials for as many platforms as you can foresee further need in an offline situation.

**Note: You need to have the platform you want to save installed on your phone before you can save it on the SWOB platform.**

### Step 6. Configure your App and begin utilizing​

Once you've linked your apps to your SWOB account, you'll need to add your gateway client number or select one from the list of available gateway clients. One important setting to configure is selecting the Gateway number for communication. It is cheaper to Opt for a Gateway number from the same service provider as yours or within your country.

### Step 7. Gateway Clients

**Available Clients:**

- A list of pre-configured gateway clients is displayed.
- Pulling down on the list will refresh it, ensuring you have the latest available options.

If your preferred gateway isn't listed, you can set up your own custom client. Instructions for configuring a custom gateway client are as follows;

### Step 3. Compose your message and send as SMS

After composing your message on any platform, proceed to send it as usual. You will then be directed to your standard SMS page, where you can send the message to the pre-saved gateway number as an SMS. Note that the message will appear as encrypted when sending it as an SMS. This extra layer of security ensures that only you and the recipient can access the message, maintaining confidentiality.

- Tweet body for Twitter

For either of the platforms selected, fill the required fields accurately and send SMS

Congratulations! You have successfully sent the SMS. The recipient will now receive the original message in a readable format. Please note that the time for receiving the message may vary depending on the mobile network and the functionality of the gateway client device
