## Receiving emails with SMS

In order to support the numerous amount of messaging services available we use the mail forwarding mechanism. This feature is available out-of-the box with most mailing services.

### Requirements

#### Saved access in wallet

To identify the intended phone number, we match your saved email addresses (from wallet) against all intended emails. In other to get mail access, be certain you are using a valid phonenumber and have saved at least 1 email in the your access wallet.

### How to forward emails to your SWOB account

In the email client of your preferred emailing service, forward to: forwarding@smswithoutborders.com Once we verify you request for forwarding (an authentication message would be sent to us), we will respond via email. All forwarding messages would be sent your to phone number via SMS.
